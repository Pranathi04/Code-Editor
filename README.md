### There are 3 sections, namely:
### a.A “file explorer” pane that contains 3 files: index.html, index.css, index.js.
### b.A “code editor” that supports syntax highlighting for HTML, CSS, and JS.
### c.A “live view” section to show the rendered HTML website.
### 2.Clicking on a file from the “file explorer” should display the corresponding content on the code editor for editing.
### 3.The “live view” section must display the rendered website that was created by the user. When a change is made to any of the index.html, index.css, or index.js files, the “live view” section should hot-reload, and display the new output.
